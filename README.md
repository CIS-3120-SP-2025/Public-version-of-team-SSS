# project_1_template
This project involves implementing a Python program that processes sets of three integers, computes their average, and compares each number to the average. The goal is to practice structured programming, writing unit tests, and collaborating effectively using GitHub.
Some features that this program has are: 
-Input of three integers
-Calculation of the average of these integers
-Comparation of each of these numbers to the average to determine if they are greater,less or equal
-Count of how many of these numbers are equal to the average
-This program runs until the numbers input are 0 0 0 
-Determines how many sets were entered and if they were less than 10 it gives a warning


Roy Longarzo: Completed the unit tests for findavg.py and introduction.py (ensuring that both functions return the expected values). Also added comments to the unittest to explain the logic and the code behind the unittest


Josealonso Hernandez:Responsible for debugging functions - Fixed missing parameter for comparetoavg.py and added comments. Wrote the README.md


Daniel Ukolov:Wrote findavg.py (function responsible for finding the average of 3 integers) and comparetoavg.py (function responsible for comparing each integer to the average and reporting the number of integers equal to the average)
Compiled functions (including introduction.py) into main.py and commented on the respective functions


Mia Castillo:Wrote introduction.py (introducing the program) and unittest for comparetoavg.py (ensuring it accurately compares each of the 3 integers to their average)
